What is GEM5?
------------

[GEM5][GEM5-link] is a popular cycle-accurate simulator. I am current using it,
so I am taking some notes on it for future reference. The notes here is based
on current version of GEM5(version around the time this blog posted)

ITLB access in O3CPU
-----------

ITLB accesses of a O3CPU is initiated in **src/cpu/o3/fetch_impl.h**.

The workflow is show below in the graph(from [GEM5][GEM5-link] website):

![Fetch Workflow](Fetch.png)

1. In function *fetchCacheLine*, a *RequestPtr* is contructed with the
to-be-translated instruction address. Then the request will be sent to
cpu's ITLB.

2. In ITLB, *translateTiming* function will process this request immediately
by checking TLB structure. However, it will not make a delay of TLB request
if it hits in the TLB. The request will be forwarded back to Fetch Unit via
function *finishTranslation* in the same cycle.

3. Inside *finishTranslation* function, physical address will be extracted and
sent to Instruction Cache in the same cycle.

4. Therefore, ITLB access takes no cycle to finish. As I confirmed with one of
GEM5 developers, they assume TLB accesses proceed in parallel with Cache access.
