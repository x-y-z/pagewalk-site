What is GEM5?
------------

[GEM5][GEM5-link] is a popular cycle-accurate simulator. I am current using it,
so I am taking some notes on it for future reference. The notes here is based
on current version of GEM5(version around the time this blog posted)

ITLB access in O3CPU
-----------

ITLB accesses of a O3CPU is initiated in **src/cpu/o3/fetch_impl.h**.

The workflow is show below in the graph(from [GEM5][GEM5-link] website):

![Fetch Workflow]({{media_url('images/2014/04/23/Fetch.png')}})

The above flowchart uses ARM ISA as an example, but other architecture
should share the same steps.

Something worth noticing:

1.  In function `fetchCacheLine`, a `RequestPtr` is contructed with the
    to-be-translated instruction address. Then the request will be sent to
    cpu's ITLB.

2.  In ITLB, `translateTiming` function will process this request immediately
    by checking TLB structure. However, it will not make a delay of TLB request
    if it hits in the TLB. The request will be forwarded back to Fetch Unit via
    function `finishTranslation` in the same cycle.

3.  Inside `finishTranslation` function, physical address will be extracted and
    sent to Instruction Cache in the same cycle.

4.  Therefore, ITLB access takes no cycle to finish. As I confirmed with one of
    GEM5 developers, they assume TLB accesses proceed in parallel with Cache
    access.


How to add TLB access latency.
-----------------
If you want to make TLB show its latency in the critical path, you need to delay
the return of TLB translation results. You either delay it in **src/arch/
\[Architecture\]/tlb.cc**, or send out TLB request after N cycles like me.

Here is how I did it:

1.  Add a class `TLBAccessDelayEvent` which derived from `Event` by referring
    `FinishTranslationEvent`. You need those members in the class:

        O3CPU *cpu;
        DefaultFetch<Impl> *fetch
        RequestPtr req;
        ThreadID tid;

2.  Put TLB translation request action inside `process` function, like:

        FetchTranslation *trans = new FetchTranslation(fetch);
        cpu->itb->translateTiming(req, cpu->thread[tid]->getTC(),
                                  trans, BaseTLB::Execute);

3.  Set all members in the class, and schedule the event:

        cpu->schedule(tlbAccessDelayEvent[tid],
                      cpu->clockEdge(Cycles(1)));

    The 1 above tells cpu to schedule the event after 1 cycle, and you can
    change it to your TLB access latency.

In this way, I manage to put additional TLB access latency in the critical
path. It works. Any comment is welcomed.
